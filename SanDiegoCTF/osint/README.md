# Clues

I will not be releasing any full fledged writeups for each of the challenges as its absolutely unnecessary for OSINT challenges. I will however provide clues for each of the challenges if you do get stuck.  

- speed-studying - we check out the faculty directory for math or computer science at UCSD (answer is Daniel Kane)
- speed-studying-2 - Probably search for Daniel Kane's lectures or homework problems.
- hide-and-seek - ?v=hqXOIZtRYZU looks like a youtube video id. the jpeg could be something from an image sharing service
- hide-and-seek-2 - gg/4KcDWnUYMs. Now which website has a `.gg` domain? Maybe try copying a message link and see how it looks.
- this-flag-has-been-stolen - maybe the wayback machine?
