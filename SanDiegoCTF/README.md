# San Diego CTF

San Diego CTF, also known as SDCTF, is an annual Capture the Flag competition hosted by undergraduates at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The competition will be jeopardy-style and run in the 48 hour period from May 7 to May 9, 2021. We encourage participation from teams on and off campus, of all ages and backgrounds.

This event is hosted yearly by ACM Cyber, the chief cybersecurity organization on campus at UC San Diego. This yearly competition allows us to train our members, build our internal resources, and give back to the greater cybersecurity community.

Here, you will be able to find writeups to challenges I was able to solve. My team was "wannabehackers" and we placed 41st on the leaderboard. Not too shabby for my first CTF.
